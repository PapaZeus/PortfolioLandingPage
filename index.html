              Hi, my name is Brady Klockenga. Today I am starting to creating my professional landing page for my term here at Epicodus showcasing some of my working, functional projects I have created while studying under the fantasic Epicodus establishment/curriculum. As for a little about me, I started my existance in a smaller town named Springfield, IL. I grew up and graduated highschool there then shortly after experienced myself wanting more out of life so I moved to Daytona Beach, Florida. <br><br>I started off at Daytona State, was in the Honors College but shortly dropped out due to unhappiness as to where my life was headed. I then recieved my Real Estate License and did that and some property management on the side for 5 years. <br><br>After again wanting more out of life, I decided to move to Seattle where fast forward a year, I worked a dead end job and now have a 5 month year old sweet little boy named Apollo. As to why I joined Epicodus, enough was enough.. I decided to finally do something with my life that I <span>actually</span> enjoy. I've been into tech as long as I can remember. For the first time in my life I finally feel free and like everything is going accorinding to plan which is why I chose the picture I did to represent the feeling of freedom that I have so long searched long and hard for. However, this is only the beginning of my journey. Long roads and challenages await me but I can confidently say I will embrace them head on, something I couldn't.. wouldn't of said in the past. <em>Bring it on universe!</em>

              The title links above the descriptions will bring you to all of the games I have listed websites in case you want to check out/purchase the game yourself. The contents of the rows contain the title of the games, a biref description using Lorem Ipsum, and unorder list telling you the price of the game, what type of game it is, and finally my rating of the game.
